## What is this?

My CV written in LaTeX format, with a GitHub Actions workflow
to generate a PDF which is added as an asset to release tags produced by
Semantic Release.

## Motivation

LaTeX is something I last used at university to write my dissertation and I
found that, while challenging, it gave me really great control over the final
document. Traditional word processors never gave me the same control I remember
having, and now it is not nearly as challenging as it was when I was new to
programming.

Having everything in a git repo also means I'll never have to search for my most
recent CV again. A nice bonus is that I'll have a nice history of my CV over the
years.

Using GitHub Actions to generate the final PDF document means I know the PDF
matches the source code, it also means I don't need to use Dropbox anymore.

I decided to use semantic-release to produce releases and then upload the
generated PDF as an asset to them so I can control the public facing iterations
using branches and commits.

## Setup

### Mac

#### Install MacTeX

- Download and install [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/)
- Open TeX Live Utility and update

#### Add executables to PATH
