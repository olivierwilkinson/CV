\maketitle

One of my great joys is sharing in someone's passion with them, it is equal
parts fascinating and broadening, often sparking my own interest or a change in
perspective. This is the one of the aspects fundamental to my love of Software
Engineering: it is a field of enourmous scope and variety, full of individuals
passionate about their craft. Excitement for different ideas or perspectives
can be infectious, not only advancing my own skills but also the skills of those
around me. I can say confidently that all of my peers have improved me as a
developer, and that they would say the same about me.
